## Opaku Privacy Policy

This site is for the privacy policy for the sudoku game Opaku. 

### Opaku does not collect any user data

With Opaku, everything you do, you control. Every puzzle you solve or create is stored on your phone and has no automatic uplink to the cloud, and same for all saved information, like your preferences within the app. If you ever want to upload a puzzle to the cloud though, you are in control of the entire upload process, and can decide to simply not share your seed to the cloud even after it's been made - no one will know what the seed is until you choose to share it.

In terms of the app, the only things it has access to is reading/writing information to/from it's own internal folder (so only saved preferences, puzzles etc), internet in case you want to upload sudokus to the cloud, and stopping your phone turning off the screen after 30 seconds or so of inactivity - I'm not great at sudoku and sometimes stare at it for a minute or two before seeing something, and I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want it lock on me when I can't figure out any of the next steps!

And with that, that's it!

Seriously. There's no ads, no need to login to anything, no need to send data to anything or anyone - in fact, if you never want to use the upload feature and don't even turn your internet on, you can still create/solve sudokus perfectly fine!

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at opasudoku@gmail.com
